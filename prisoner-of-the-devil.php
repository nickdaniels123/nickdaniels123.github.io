          <p><em>Sherlock Holmes is back&mdash;after thirty years out of print&mdash;to delve into the murky waters of the notorious Dreyfus affair and calm diplomatic tensions, in this celebrated homage. For the first time includes a dramatic alternative ending.</em></p>
          <blockquote>&lsquo;In a class by itself! This book has caught my father&rsquo;s style marvellously.&rsquo;</blockquote>
          <p><em>&mdash; Dame Jean Conan Doyle</em></p>
          <p>1895. Devil&rsquo;s Island, off the coast of French Guiana. A solitary prisoner waits for the heat, disease and malnutrition of the tropics to bring the merciful release of death. A fitting end for a despicable traitor, or grotesque miscarriage of justice? In distant London, fresh from two years of self-imposed exile&mdash;following his duel with arch-villain Professor Moriarty and apparent death at the Reichenbach Falls&mdash;Sherlock Holmes is petitioned by the convict&rsquo;s brother to uncover the truth that will free Alfred Dreyfus. With dark clouds of war already beginning to gather over Europe and Dreyfus&rsquo;s guilt seemingly beyond doubt, the great detective is reluctant to take on the task. That is until his sovereign, Queen Victoria, makes a direct and secret request. Duty-bound to bring his supreme skills of observation and deduction into play, Holmes embarks on perilous travels near and far, with trusty confidant Dr John Watson at his side, to reopen the case against the Prisoner of the Devil.</p>
          <p>On its publication in 1979, Prisoner of the Devil received broad critical acclaim as the best Sherlock Holmes pastiche ever written; it is the only new Holmes story ever endorsed by Dame Jean Conan Doyle, daughter of the author of the most enduring character in crime fiction and guardian of his literary legacy. Out of print since the mid-1980s, Prisoner of the Devil is being rereleased with the help of one of its original creators, Simon Haugh, in a new edition that features for the first time a postscript outlining an alternative and previously discarded ending. Tipped by the Sherlock Holmes Journal as &lsquo;The book we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for.&rsquo;</p>
