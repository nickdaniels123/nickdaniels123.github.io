          <p><span class="smallcaps">Facing his</span> options squarely isn’t helping. Staring at them does no good. Jury’s hung between beech and maple. It ricochets back and forth, side to side, beneath the cool, night-for-day fluorescence of Home Depot’s specialty timber aisle. Myron Kepple runs his fingertips along the grain of smooth-planed lengths of the alternatives, beech and maple. Maple or beech? Which is the more durable? Which makes a statement?</p>
          <div class="indent-first-line-of-paragraph">
          <p>He seeks out a sales assistant, a nearly extinct species at the hangar-sized warehouse in Mohegan Lake. To be fair, it <em>is</em> a sultry Saturday night. Two forty-seven in the Sunday <span class="smallcaps">a.m.</span>, to be fairer still. Eventually he ropes a woman working the window treatments concession; she puts a call through to the back office, which in turn sends a message across the store’s public address that should have brought forth a Clint Walkeresque lumberjack, keys and measuring tape, T-squares and hammers and scoring implements jangling from his waist as he doubles it to Myron’s side.</p>
          <p>What in fact the message brings is an acne-scarred doughboy. Built like a porta-potty, he’s somehow gotten a leather supporter around his waist, which Myron guesses does less to discourage ruptures than to rein in his gut the way a mold does a fresh-cooked custard, so it won’t spread into a shapeless puddle of grease.</p>
          <p>Myron explains he’s looking for wood. “For closets.”</p>
          <p>“I’d say you’d found it.”</p>
          <p>There is a shitload of the stuff, no denying. On shelves and in bins as far as the eye can see. Enough for closets; enough for a Roman slave galley, complete with spare set of oars. Add the rough-cut and general-purpose stock in the next aisle, enough to raise the lost city of Atlantis onto a platform and stilts.</p>
          <p>“I’m building his and her clothes closets, either side of the bed.”</p>
          <p>“Nice.”</p>
          <p>“Running bookshelves between them.”</p>
          <p>“Hey,” the doughboy says. “Nice.”</p>
          <p>“Over the head of the bed, you know.”</p>
          <p>“Over the bed.”</p>
          <p>“I was going to use beech. You think that’ll work?”</p>
          <p>The doughboy nods his head. “Put in a rail and buy some hangars, it’ll work.”</p>
          <p>“I meant, how would it look.”</p>
          <p>“Look?”</p>
          <p>“In beech.”</p>
          <p>Hoists his truss. “Like beechwood hanging closets.”</p>
          <p>“Maybe maple would be better?”</p>
          <p>“Expensive, maple…”</p>
          <p>Myron fishes inside his butt pocket.</p>
          <p>“…but nice.”</p>
          <p>“I don’t need too much. Here, I’ve got the measurements. What I’m not sure about is, is maple strong enough? I’d go with maple if it was strong enough.”</p>
          <p>“Maple’s like a hardwood.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I think not.” Actually, Myron knows not; he hasn’t driven out to Home Depot at two forty-seven on a Sunday morning without first doing his homework.</p>
          <p>The doughboy smiles. Everybody’s gotta be an arboriculturist. “Whad I say?”</p>
          <p>“You said maple was a hardwood.”</p>
          <p>“<em>Like</em>. Like a hardwood is what I said. It’s dense. Extra dense. You gonna use a router?”</p>
          <p>“I’ve rented a workbench.”</p>
          <p>The doughboy’s tongue buffs his front teeth. “You’re gonna use a router, better make sure it’s a good one, and new. It’s not super-sharp, you’re gonna gouge the wood. And scorch it. Maple scorches easy. What are you using for doors?”</p>
          <p>“Doors?”</p>
          <p>“The things that open and close so’s you and the missus can get to your clothes. Don’t wanna be taking the kids to school in your birthday suits.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” Myron says. “Doors.”</p>
          <p>“Ply’s your best bet. Veneer. If you go with the maple, you’ll need birch ply. Next aisle over, at the far end. Comes in sheets of eight-by-four.”</p>
          <p>“Why wouldn’t I want maple ply?”</p>
          <p>“No reason. Reason you can’t have it is, they don’t make it. No sweat; maple, birch—your worst enemy couldn’t tell the diff, and your best friend won’t squeal. They going to be inset or external, the doors?”</p>
          <p>“Uhm, external.”</p>
          <p>“Smart money. External hides a multitude of sins. Go for sprung hinges. Hardware, aisle eleven. Go for double-sprung, and you won’t need fasteners. Unless you want to keep the crotchless panties and the six-inch heels secret from the missus, huh? Knobs, handles—metal, aisle eleven; wood, this aisle. Rail and rail cups—chrome or brass, aisle twelve; wood, this aisle. Moldings to front the shelves, next aisle near the front. Aisle nine for screws and nails. Glue and varnish, and Bob Vila’s your uncle.”</p>
          <p>Unable to saw in a straight line if his life were on it, Myron Kepple presents himself, plus two dolly-loads of white Peruvian oak and his spider-scrawl measurements, at the table saw for some custom cuts. Then he jackknifes his way to the Special Services counter to pay. Arrange delivery. A couple shunts up behind him. Loud. Young middle-aged; near-identical flip-flops and cut-offs and Rolling Stones tour shirts with perma-stains of sweat under the arms. Kit them out with candy-stripe towels, a little light reading, they might be making an early start for Jones Beach.</p>
          <p>When it’s his turn up, Myron receives a stiff jab in the shoulder. The beachcombers want permission to ask Special Services a quick question. Myron stands aside. Guy asks his question, receives an answer that doesn’t much please him, then asks a follow-up. Berates the assistant for the store’s lousy product range, steps away from the counter and, succumbing to a second rising of bile, steps forward again.</p>
          <p>Myron says, “Excuse me, man— ”</p>
          <p>“What’s <em>your</em> fucking problem?”</p>
          <p>“You said one question. I was here before you.”</p>
          <p>“Give me none of your fucking lip!”</p>
          <p>“Listen, pal— ”</p>
          <p>“I’m no pal of yours, asshole.”</p>
          <p>The beachcomber grabs Myron by the throat the way he’d done the English language, and with as little by-your-leave. Myron is surprised by the strength in his stubby fingers. His wife or girlfriend or nymphomaniac stepmother, whatever, seems less put out by her guy’s cloddishness than she would have been by a chip in the brown enamel on her toenails.</p>
          <p>In an act of magnificent folly, their Special Services associate hauls himself over his counter. Over, not around. He’s some kind of Asian, which makes the beachcomber see red, and some years the beachcomber’s senior, which makes him see purple. Suddenly, Myron is small beer. Suddenly, Myron is gum stuck to the sole of one of the beachcomber’s flip-flops, and it’s too fucking hot to bother to pry him loose. In a single, fluid motion, the beachcomber flings Myron aside and takes a swing at the meddlesome old banana who didn’t know his place was behind the counter, serving. Being servile. But the punch isn’t well-anchored; it veers wide, establishing momentum that carries the beachcomber forward into a dimension of zero resistance and onto his knees.</p>
          <p>Before he can rise for the rematch, before the indignity wears off and the pain of a skinning kicks in, the beachcomber is surrounded by more store employees than Myron would have imagined were out of bed that time of night. The cordon of name tags flows and ebbs with every lunge the beachcomber attempts, keeping its distance, never making contact, never gapping to offer the beachcomber any avenue of escape. Myron slips a pocket camera out of his book bag; a Canon, self-winding, auto-focus, loaded with ISO 400 professional-quality monochrome stock. A constant companion. He fires off much of a reel at the spectacle of this wave of implacable humanity washing the beachcomber towards and through the exit.</p>
          <p>Cleavage billowing, the lady beachcomber asks about the camera: “What’s the fuckin idea?”</p>
          <p>“It’s for the Ten Most-Wanted.”</p>
          <p>Myron is longing for her to say, You’re cruisin for it!, but instead she launches a spitball at his chin. Heads for the exit in the wake of the wave. In time, Special Services returns to his counter.</p>
          <p>“Smoothly done, my man,” Myron tells him. “I guess middle of the night brings out the gremlins.”</p>
          <p>Special Services brushes the compliment aside. “Myself, I blame in-breeding.”</p>
          <p>They transact their business; Myron transfers his smaller purchases—hardware, adhesive, hand tools—to a regular shopping cart, watches his lumber being tagged for delivery and shunted to a holding bay. He steers his cart towards the exit.</p>
          <p>“Reckon I’ll chill a few minutes,” he says to those still standing sentry there.</p>
          <p>“They drove off,” a name tag reassures him.</p>
          <p>“They could be back. With a SWAT team.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span class="smallcaps">The day’s</span> first wisps of sunlight are bleeding into the sky as Myron wheels the shopping cart towards his station-wagon. He raises the tailgate; practically tips his purchases into the cargo space.</p>
          <div class="indent-first-line-of-paragraph">
          <p>Myron Kepple is a staffer on the Croton-Cortlandt <em>News</em>. He’s been that twenty-one years. Long enough to have a byline; long enough to realize he’ll be heading from his byline in the boonies past Go and directly to an assisted-living facility, unless he makes a vocational course correction. Abrupt, and damn soon.</p>
          <p>The photos are not for any wanted poster; they’re for a page deep inside the <em>News</em>, two or three column inches fighting for air among late-breaking changes in the Metro-North timetable and complaints about some new foolishness on the part of the school board. Two or three inches, if he’s lucky. “Fracas By the Flooring.” “Panic In the Paint Aisle.”</p>
          <p>Not exactly the first report of the Little Big Horn, but another tear-sheet never hurt.</p>
          <p>Sliding in behind the wheel gives him a panoramic view of the strip. Petland Discounts beyond the Home Depot, then a drugstore, an A &amp; P, a furniture outlet, discount electrical goods. Each supersized, each open twenty-four seven. A parking-lot of recently-rolled asphalt, zoned by retailer and bordered by shrubbery so uniform it probably was some kind of extruded polymer.</p>
          <p>Activity at the far end of the parking-lot, a distance of two or three ball-field lengths, catches his eye. Group of men, <em>all</em> men, hefting box after box from the appliance store to a strange vehicle, some kind of stretch camper. At four in the morning? Wholesale burglary is what it looked like, B&amp;E, though that couldn’t be it. The store was open for business. No need to break anything. No alarm bells ringing.</p>
          <p>On an impulse, the newspaperman in Myron swings his auto around the parking-lot’s perimeter. The light is improving. Myron’s perception is improving moment by moment.</p>
          <p>One of the men, old geezer keeping his distance from the heavy lifting, is sheathed, neck to ankles, in a robe. Caftan. Priest’s habit. Dressing-gown?</p>
          <p>Incautiously, Myron pulls into a slot—crisp yellow paint on the asphalt—a couple of rows from the camper. Fully lowers his window and looses off exposure after exposure at the scene before him. Storefront. Camper. Men. A seemingly endless caravan of boxes. The men are intent on their task, oblivious to the flash on Myron’s Canon, oblivious to him.</p>
          <p>Until the robed one turns his way. Happens to.</p>
          <p>Myron recognizes him, the man in the robe. Knows him from…somewhere. Socially? Uh-uh. State Assembly? Nooo. From deep in the recesses of his twenty-one years on the C-C; them, or the three before on the Ardsley <em>Courier</em>, or the four before that in Mamaroneck.</p>
          <p>Christ.</p>
          <p>The film in his camera is exhausted. Usually he carries spares, one at least— Not today. Book bag’s empty. Passenger seat. Back seat. Footwell.</p>
          <p>Of course not today. Natch, my fucking luck. “Jesus Christ.” This is the story. This is the one. Name-maker. Career-definer. The turning-point, and I’m out of <em>fucking film</em>!</p>
          <p>Then it registers. Glove compartment. The family camcorder. There because his son relief pitches and plays third base. There because his daughter dances tap and just did a moot court. He drops the Canon into the glove box, grabs the camcorder by its lens and flicks it to REWIND even as he leaves the car behind, brake off, engine idling.</p>
          <p>Seat-belt alarm going ape.</p>
          <p>It clicks who the old guy in the robe is.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Pantone.”</p>
          <p>He’s running, Myron; not something he does too often anymore. Running towards the camper. Towards the scoop of his life. Swinging the camcorder to eye-level. Bye-bye moot court; so long reverse curve.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Pantone? Hey, George.”</p>
          <p>But the old guy doesn’t look up. None of them do, these men, either totally immersed in their labor of love or totally in control of their responses.</p>
          <p>“George! Over here.”</p>
          <p>Old guy lifts his gaze, just a tad.</p>
          <p>“Yes. C’mon.”</p>
          <p>Finally.</p>
          <p>“That’s it, Geegee. Mozar-<em>ella.</em> Big smile.”</p>
          <p>The robed one opens a door to the camper, climbs in. Driver’s side. Except— He turns around, slides in ass backwards, Myron notices. A subliminal observation.</p>
          <p>The others jam into the vehicle. Front. Rear. Two carrying a huge carton between them set it down and jump in too, camper already moving, picking up speed.</p>
          <p>Shit, he’s getting away. My career-maker. This is the one I don’t lose. I DO NOT LOSE. Myron turns and sprints for his ride. No doubts. No time or room for doubt.</p>
          <p>The rush of adrenalin muffles the roar of the camper until it’s on him, slamming into him from behind. Lifting him off the tarmac. Breaking his back. He sees nothing; feels not a thing.</p>
          <p>Myron Kepple has begun his journey into death as the camper draws up beside him, slowing to allow one of its passengers to lean out and snag his camcorder. He is well gone before the camper executes a tight three-sixty, backs up, then guns over him, rear wheel crushing his skull, and spins away.</p>
