          <h3>The First Shiver</h3>
          <img class="align-right" src="img/demons-cover-300w.jpg">
          <p>New York. 1986. The seamy streets around Times Square are brought grittily to life as a down-and-out finds himself playing reluctant private eye in this moody urban crime novel.</p>
          <p>Middle-aged and overweight, Stanley Shiver is no New York success story. Home is the cold-water attic atop the Calypso, an adult movie theatre; his nine-to-five is keeping the peace in the Calypso&rsquo;s auditorium and unclogging its toilets. Until an unexpected turn of events sees Shiver taking on responsibility&mdash;something he&rsquo;s tried mightily to avoid&mdash;and a real job: investigator, unlicensed and ill-equipped, nosing around the tangled life of an iconic former boxing champ and the suicide of a troubled cop. Along the way, Shiver and his Rastafarian mentor save the Calypso from a crusading televangelist and fail to save skinflick director Howie Ross from his destiny. Dark times in the big city: only the lucky, the street-smart and the slightly unhinged can hope to survive.</p>
          <p>The Times Square area, New York&rsquo;s theatre district, was a different world thirty years ago. Today, it&rsquo;s a tourist mecca, sterilised and Disneyfied, but back in the day it was a volatile melting pot of smooth operators and rough trade; wall-to-wall porn shops, prostitutes, flashers and drug dealers. The Shiver novels are a wildly entertaining evocation of a reality crime fiction rarely invades. There are no serial killers on Shiver&rsquo;s horizon; no tortured tycoons or missing heiresses; no voluptuous blondes. Petty scams and little vices are Shiver&rsquo;s beat. But, as he soon discovers, small can be large. Tiny can sometimes buy you a barrelful of grief.</p>
